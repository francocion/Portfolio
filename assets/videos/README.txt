This folder is for your local video files.

- To use local videos: place your mp4 files here and update the `data-video-src` attribute in `index.html` to a relative path (e.g. `assets/videos/my-showreel.mp4`).
- For quick testing you can use the external sample links already in `index.html`.

Tips:
- Keep web-optimized H.264 mp4 files for best compatibility.
- Add small poster images or SVG thumbnails in `assets/` and set `img` src values in each `.card`.
